# Integrity with other plugins
I make these plugins for me, according to my needs, meaning, I don't search for every possible plugin that I don't care about, that could be somehow better integrated with mine. But, if you care about better integration between this plugin and some other, then just let me know through [Discord](https://discord.gg/kZJhKZ48j8) or GitHub and I will see what I can do.

Same goes for any features that you think may be missing. If something isn't outside the scope of the plugin, then I'll probably do it.
