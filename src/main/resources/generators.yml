    # Simple math:
    # CG full durability - (IG full durability - IG durability) = CG durability
    # CG - crafted generator
    # IG - ingredient generator
    #
    # So for example we have generator that full durability is 2000 and durability
    # left is 1500. We are creating better generator which full durability is 3000.
    # In that case durability of crafted generator will be:
    # 3000 - (2000 - 1500) = 2500
